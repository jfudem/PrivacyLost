## Abstract
Every time you send a text, read an email, open Facebook, or make an online purchase, you must consider who else might have access to your personal information. Often, the answer is quite alarming.

Online privacy and digital surveillance are frequently-discussed, news-worthy, front-page topics. However, the issues are typically presented and viewed in the context of legal battles, tracking policies or government whistle blowing, while the real concerns about personal privacy and data protection are underplayed or ignored. Unfortunately, amidst the confusion surrounding the critical questions about ethics and encryption, a sense of general immediacy or terror is lost or sacrificed, even when, as average web users, we are the unwitting but participatory victims of data collection.

Personal privacy and security are the critical topics discussed in Privacy Lost: Owning Our Data in Digital Culture, which employs â€œgamification" to cut through the layers of technical detail and legal obfuscation to focus on the basic human stories and values that are threatened by our routine surrender of data. Private Affairs and LOVEINT are two original games that place you, the player, in the role of an empowered, greedy, data mogul or an NSA Analyst. Gameplay elements put real life personal secrets at stake, and prompt us to question just how much our data are worth, as our privacy is increasingly commodified by corporations and governments.

Privacy, the protection of our personal and sometimes secret relationships, communications and behaviors is the most intimate right we possess. I hope that my games help people move beyond surface level conversations to critically engage with a challenging but essential topic - How much are your data worth?
