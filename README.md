# Privacy Lost: Owning Our Data In Digital Culture
## A Game Based Media Research Thesis by Jonathan Fudem

### Abstract
Every time you send a text, read an email or open Facebook, you have to wonder who else might have access to your information. Often the answers are quite alarming.
Online privacy and digital surveillance are topics we hear a lot about in the news but usually only in the context of legal battles, tracking policies or government whistle blowing. Lost in this fog of questions about ethics and encryption, is a sense of general immediacy or terror for us, average web users, when we are the unwitting but participatory victims of data collection.
Privacy Lost: Owning our data in digital culture uses gamification to cut through the layers of technical detail and legal obfuscation and focus the basic human stories and values threatened by our routine surrender of data. LOVEINT and Private Affairs are two original games that place you, the player in the role of an empowered, greedy, data mogul or NSA Analyst. Gameplay elements put real life personal secrets at stake, and prompt us to question just how much our data are worth as our privacy is increasingly commodified by governments and corporations.
Privacy, the protection of our personal and sometimes secret relationships, communications and behaviors is the most intimate right we possess. I hope that my games can help people move beyond surface level conversations and critically engage with a challenging but essential topic.
How much are your data worth?
